The following resources were used as basis for the math and logic of Ship generation and hit detection:
- [Line Segment Intersection Detection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/check-if-two-given-line-segments-intersect/) by GeeksforGeeks (used for preventing ships from generating in positions already taken by other ships)
- [Point in Line Segment](https://lucidar.me/en/mathematics/check-if-a-point-belongs-on-a-line-segment/) by Lulu's Blog  (used for detecting hits)
